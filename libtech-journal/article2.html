    <h4 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h4>
      <p>This paper describes a study that was carried out to determine the future of the World Wide Web.  The study concentrated on addressing the basic functionality of the Web,  but touched upon pageless design, virtual reality and automated coding. It doesn't actually make a lot of sense.</p>
       <h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 <a href="#ho">(Ho, 1997).</a> </p>
    <h4 id="web">THE WEB</h4>
        <p>The Web is basically a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files <a href="#one">[1]</a>.</p>
        <h5>The top most visited sites <a href="#two">[2]</a> might be</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Google.com</li>
      <li>Youtube.com</li>
      <li>Facebook.com</li>
      <li>Baidu.com</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="moreweb">MORE ABOUT THE WEB</h4>
        <p>In a Wired cover story of 2010, then-editor-in-chief Chris Anderson proclaimed the demise of the World Wide Web: "Two decades after its birth, the World Wide Web is in decline" <a href="#anderson"> (Anderson, 2010).</a>  This was illustrated by Figure 1. </p>
        <p>In 2016, Anderson changed his mind, in an article entitled "Wait! The Web isn't dead after all" <a href="#anderson2">(Anderson, 2016)</a>. But, in 2015, it appeared that apps were not winning over the mobile browser, as demonstrated in Figure 2.  </p>
    <h4 id="usability">WHITHER WEB USABILITY?</h4>
        <p>Usability refers to 搕he extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use� <a href="#three">[3]</a>.
          Usability testing is fast becoming a central component in the design and evaluation of software such as digital libraries (<a href="#goerge">George, 2008</a>; <a href="#long">Long et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#nor">Norberg et al.,2005</a>). Such testing involves representative users attempting realistic tasks using the system under test. The users are generally asked to think out loud while completing the tasks. Observation and note-taking by a facilitator, accompanied by video recording, is generally found to produce the best results. Such a usability study provides researchers with a mental model of a participant抯 use of a system, as well as providing a better understanding of how the system works (<a href="#clark">Clark, 2004</a>; <a href="#goerge5">George, 2005</a>; <a href="#goerge">George, 2008</a>)</p>
        <p>When compared with other methods of assessing software, usability testing has been found to be effective and efficient. For example, <a href="#ahmed">Ahmed (2008)</a> found usability testing using actual users had a higher percentage of problems than testing using heuristic evaluation or cognitive walkthrough.</p>
    <h4 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
    <p>This article doesn't really make sense. It is just supposed to test your ability to markup in HTML and CSS.</p>
